### A designer among thousands of developers...

Hey! 👋 I'm an enthusiastic Product Designer who loves improving UX for users, interested in web development, and love collaborating on theocratic projects.
Currently, I'm working on the [Organized app](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app), which helps congregations manage all aspects of their theocratic life, saving hundreds of hours and reducing tons of stress. Also, I'm happy to contribute my UI/UX skills to another app I use and love, [Meeting Media Manager](https://github.com/sircharlo/meeting-media-manager)!
